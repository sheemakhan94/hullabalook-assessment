      <h1>Welcome to the Hullabalook Technical Challenge!</h1>
      <h2>The Brief</h2>
      <p>
         A member of the Sales team has just got back from a meeting with a potential new client.
         The client has asked if we could create an interactive experience for their online customers.
         The purpose of the experience is to inform their most loyal customers of the variety of brands they sell.
       </p>
       <p>
         They want us to create a pairing game whereby the user is faced with four product images and four brand logos, and they need to match the product to the brand logo.
         To help illustrate what kind of experience they're looking for they've included a wireframe (below).
       </p>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="./data/example.png">
      </div>
      <p>
        It's your task to show what we could do! If you want to follow their design that's fine. But, they've given you full artistic reign to display the experience any way you wish!
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example, the client has sent over four images along with the brand that it belongs to. You can find these in the data directory of the project.
      </p>
      <h1>***</h1>
      <p>
        The challenge is purposefully open in order to give you an opportunity to shine in the areas that interest you most. Whether it's the design, the interactivity, the data or a bit of everything, take this as an oppotunity to show off your skills and interests!
        Also, if you have any interests that you'd like to apply this idea to, please don't feel you have to use trainers - you can apply the pairing game to almost anything!
      </p>
      <p>
        You should aim to spend around 5 hours working on this project. The scaffolding of a Vue.js project has been created and it's recommended to continue the project in this style.
